AUTOMATED INTELLIGENT GREENHOUSE

In today's day and age, it seems unnatural to be living in a world that is not solving our
problems and making our lives simpler. The motivation for our project came precisely from this notion.

'Intelligent Greenhouse' is an arduino -based project wherein we will automate its working
to a great extent, if not fully, in order to reduce manual labor. A greenhouse is a controlled-
area-environment for the growth of plants. It is a structural building with different types of
covering materials such as glass or plastic. It heats up because the transparent glass traps
the incoming solar radiation, and is absorbed by the plants inside.

Automatic greenhouse involves the automatic monitoring and controlling the climatic
parameters like light, temperature, humidity and moisture in the soil, which directly or indirectly
govern the plant growth. The heart of this project is the Atmega328p.

Analog signals from different sensors used to measure physical quantities will be fed into
the microcontroller and according to the set threshold values different output device will be
switched ON/OFF to maintain the climatic parameters.
